# Clustering-Lands-data-using-their-GEO-location
Using K-Means Clustering to create clusters of lands.

Analysis property data is quite tricky. I have used K-Means clustering on the dataset of a county to create clusters of data. Although the data provided by the 3rd party was not great, the accuracy of the model was quite accurate based on the geo location. It helps me to identify trends in certain real estate market. Do analysis in much more macro level. I have used Plotly to visualize the clusters too.
